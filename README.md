# Bonfire.Federate.ActivityPub

An extension for [Bonfire](https://bonfire.cafe/) that handles:

- Extensible/configurable tools for translating Bonfire data to/from ActivityStreams
- Bonfire Adapter for the [ActivityPub federation library ](https://github.com/bonfire-networks/activity_pub)

## Testing

There are unit tests both in this repo, and in the activity_pub lib, but they can't cover every possible federation case, so manual testing with e.g. `curl -H "Accept: application/activity+json" -v "http://localhost:4000/pub/actors/my_username" | jq '.'` and by trying out federation flows between instances of Bonfire and other ActivityPub implementation is a must.
